# Emotion-Detection-Model-for-Facial-Expressions

Objective: Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify facial expressions.
Developed a CNN model to classify facial expressions into seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear,
Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise, achieving 62.05% accuracy.
Trained over 120 epochs with optimised hyperparameters, applied grayscale image processing and
dataset normalisation to enhance performance.
Created a Flask-based web application with an intuitive UI for interactive emotion classification.
